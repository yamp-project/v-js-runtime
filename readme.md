This project is the YAMP Javascript Runtime.

The dependencies are the following:
- V8helper from LeonMrBonnie (private repo for now)
- [subprocess.h](https://github.com/sheredom/subprocess.h/tree/master) - A simple one header solution to launching processes and interacting with them for C/C++.

TODO:
- [ ] The runtime should read the resource config file and not rely on the sdk resource infos imo
